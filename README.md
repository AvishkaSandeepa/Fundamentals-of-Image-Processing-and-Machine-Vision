# Fundamentals-of-Image-Processing-and-Machine-Vision

This is a module that I study at university. This contains examples and projects.  

I used window as my os and [**python**](https://www.python.org/) as my language but you can use [**matlab**](https://www.filehorse.com/download-matlab/#:~:text=MATLAB%20for%20PC%20combines%20a,matrix%20and%20array%20mathematics%20directly.&text=Iterate%20until%20you've%20got,reproduce%20or%20automate%20your%20work.) also.  
I did the examples using [opencv](https://opencv.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [numpy](https://numpy.org/) libraries.
